# CSCI 4239 Final Project: PlotComplex

## A graphing calculator for complex functions

TODO:
  - function input
    - buttons to click for each input
    - javascript to parse button clicking and output an accurate equation
    - PRIORITY: logic for * and /, how do we display the fxn?
    - STRETCH: branch cuts
  - view 1: convert existing C to webgl 
    - add potential user-determined input range
  - view 2: convert existing C to webgl
    - lines for real and imaginary axes?
  - view 3
    - VBO: flat plane made up of many evenly spaced triangles
    - vertex shader moves vertices according to function evaluation
    - same frag shader as for view 1? might need to be slightly different
  - STETCH: contour lines
